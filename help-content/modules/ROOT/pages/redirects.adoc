= Redirects Help

You can view redirects that you have created or add them directly yourself from the Cockpit. You must publish any changes you make to redirects.
Use the *Add* button to create a new redirect, *Upload* to import redirects from a file, and *Publish* to apply changes.

== Good to knows

* The redirects server is a proxy server.
* Redirects are evaluated in order of appearance when entered. The first match is accepted.
* We use the Source URL to detect duplicate entries when you add a single redirect or batch import redirects (CSV).
* If the redirect you enter is a duplicate, you get a 409 error code, showing the duplicate already exists. If there are any duplicates in a batch import of redirects, the entire batch is rejected. However, we notify you in the cockpit of the specific duplicate entries so you can remove them from the batch.
* Only `3xx` status codes are acceptable. 
Different codes affect the browser in different ways. For more, see here.
