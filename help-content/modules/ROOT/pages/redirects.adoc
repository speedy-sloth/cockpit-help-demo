= Redirects Help

You can view redirects that you have created or add them directly yourself from the Cockpit. You must publish any changes you make to redirects.
Use the *Add* button to create a new redirect, *Upload* to import redirects from a file, and *Publish* to apply changes.

== Good to knows

* The redirects server is a proxy server.
* Redirects are evaluated in order of appearance when entered. The first match is accepted.
* We use the Source URL to detect duplicate entries when you add a single redirect or batch import redirects (CSV).
